# new-physics-of-gravity
New theory of gravity (Geometry-Dependent Dispersed Mass Gravity). Applicable at every scale. The theory successfully models galaxy rotation curves, galaxy clusters, quasar energy, and other objects. No need for Dark Matter, MOND, General Relativity (OTW), or any other existing theory.
